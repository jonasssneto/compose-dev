# Purpose
As a developer, I often need to run containers for databases and development tools.
This repository brings all these services together in one place — simple, practical, and powered by Docker.

# Contributing
Everyone is welcome to collaborate!
If you have a useful setup, database, or tool you frequently use in development, feel free to:

- Fork this repository
- Add your service under a new folder (e.g. mongodb/, elasticsearch/, etc.)
- Submit a pull request 🚀
